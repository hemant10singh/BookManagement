*Deliverables:

Node.js Project: -The Node.js project contains the implementation of the REST API as described in the problem statement.The project structure includes the following files:

1. server.js: The main file that starts the server and defines the API endpoints and defines the database connection and configuration settings.
2. routers/books.js: Defines the CRUD operations for the books resource.
3. models/book.js: Defines the schema for the book object and the methods for interacting with the database.
4. package.json: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
*Documentation:

-The documentation provides instructions on how to install, configure, and use the API. The following steps are required to get started:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub link provided.
2. Install Node.js on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal/command prompt.
4. Run the command "npm install" to install the project dependencies.
5. Start the server by running the command "npm start".
6. Use an HTTP client (such as Postman or cURL) to send requests to the API endpoints.

The documentation also provides information on the expected format of the API requests and responses, as well as example requests and responses for each API endpoint.

*Design Decisions:

-In designing the API, I chose to adhere to RESTful principles and keep the code modular and easy to understand. The API follows the standard CRUD operations for the books resource, with each book having a unique identifier, title, author, description, and published date. The API uses JSON as its primary data format.

To interact with the database, I used the Mongoose library, which provides a schema-based solution to model your application data. The database connection is defined in a separate configuration file to make it easy to switch to a different database in the future.

To ensure security, the API includes input validation to prevent injection attacks and uses appropriate error handling to prevent data leakage. However, authentication and authorization were not implemented in this solution.

Limitations: This solution is intended to be a simple example of how to implement a RESTful API for managing a collection of books. As such, it has some limitations that should be addressed for a production-ready solution. These limitations include:

1. Lack of authentication and authorization: The API currently does not implement any authentication or authorization mechanisms, which may be required in a production environment.
2. Limited testing: While the solution includes basic unit tests, additional testing (such as integration testing and load testing) may be required for a production-ready solution.
3. Limited scalability: The current solution is designed to work with a small collection of books. For larger collections, additional features such as pagination and filtering would be required to ensure performance and scalability.
